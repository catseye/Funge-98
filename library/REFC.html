<center><h1>Referenced Cells Extension</h1>
<h3>Fingerprint 0x52454643 ('REFC')</h3>
</center>

<p>Under development.

<p>The REFC fingerprint allows vectors to be encoded into
and decoded from single scalar cell values.

<p>After successfully loading REFC, the instructions
<tt>D</tt> and <tt>R</tt>
take on new semantics.

<p><tt>R</tt> 'Reference' pops a vector off the stack,
and pushes a scalar value back onto the stack, unique
within an internal list of references, which refers
to that vector.

<p><tt>D</tt> 'Dereference' pops a scalar value off the
stack, and pushes the vector back onto the stack which
corresponds to that unique reference value.

<p>The internal list of references is considered
shared among all IP's, so a global static can be used
to store this list, so that this extension remains tame.

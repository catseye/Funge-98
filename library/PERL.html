<center><h1>Generic Interface to the Perl Language</h1>
<h3>Fingerprint 0x5045524c ('PERL')</h3>
</center>

<p>Under development.

<p>The PERL fingerprint is designed to provide a basic,
no-frills interface to the Perl language.

<p>After successfully loading PERL, the instructions
<tt>E</tt>, <tt>I</tt>, and <tt>S</tt>
take on new semantics.

<p><tt>S</tt> ('Shelled')
pushes a 0 on the stack if the Perl language
is already loaded (e.g. the interpreter is written in Perl).
It pushes a 1 on the stack otherwise, indicating that the
Perl language will be shelled when needed.

<p><tt>E</tt> ('Eval') pops a 0gnirts string and
performs a Perl <code>eval()</code> on it, possibly (or
not) shelling Perl as indicated by S above.
The result of the call is pushed as a 0gnirts string
back onto the stack.

<P><tt>I</tt> ('Int Eval') acts the same as <tt>E</tt>, except that
the result of the call is converted to an integer and
pushed as a single cell onto the stack.

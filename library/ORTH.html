<h3>Fingerprint 0x4f525448 ('ORTH')</h3>
</center>

Under development.<p>

The ORTH fingerprint is designed to ease transition
between the Orthogonal programming language and
Befunge-98 (or higher dimension Funges.)  Even if
transition from Orthogonal is not an issue, the ORTH
library contains some potentially interesting
instructions not in standard Funge-98.<P>

After successfully loading ORTH, the instructions
<tt>A</tt>, <tt>E</tt>, <tt>G</tt>,
<tt>O</tt>, <tt>P</tt>, <tt>S</tt>,
<tt>V</tt>, <tt>W</tt>, <tt>X</tt>, <tt>Y</tt>, and <tt>Z</tt>
take on new semantics.  The following table, which
can be used to translate Orthogonal to Funge-98 and
back, includes which Orthogonal instructions they
emulate:<p>

<pre>
	Funge		Orthogonal	Semantic

	+		+		add
	*		*		multiply
	-		-		subtract
	/		/		divide
	%		%		modulo (positive values only)
>>>	A		&		bitwise AND
>>>	O		|		bitwise OR
>>>	E		^		bitwise EXOR
	!		!		logical negate
	\		~		swap
	:		@		duplicate
	$		$		pop
	<		L		go west
	>		H		go east
	^		K		go north
	v		J		go south
	]		cw		rotate right
	[		ccw		rotate left
	r		rev		reverse
>>>	X		x		change x
>>>	Y		y		change y
>>>	V		dx		change dx
>>>	W		dy		change dy
>>>	G		=		ortho get
>>>	P		#		ortho put
>>>	Z		?		ramp if zero
	,		c		output character
>>>	S		s		output string
	.		d		output decimal
	z		nop		no operation
	q		ret		quit

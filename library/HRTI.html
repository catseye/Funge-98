<h3>Fingerprint 0x48525449 ('HRTI')</h3>
</center>

<p>Under development.

<p>The HRTI fingerprint allows a Funge program to
measure elapsed time much more finely than the
clock values returned by <tt>y</tt>.

<p>After successfully loading HRTI, the instructions
<tt>E</tt>, <tt>G</tt>, <tt>M</tt>, <tt>S</tt>, and <tt>T</tt>
take on new semantics.

<p><tt>G</tt> 'Granularity' pushes the smallest clock
tick the underlying system can reliably handle, measured
in microseconds.

<p><tt>M</tt> 'Mark' designates the timer as having
been read by the IP with this ID at this instance in time.

<p><tt>T</tt> 'Timer' pushes the number of microseconds
elapsed since the last time an IP with this ID marked the
timer.  If there is no previous mark, acts like <tt>r</tt>.

<p><tt>E</tt> 'Erase mark' erases the last timer mark by this IP
(such that <tt>T</tt> above will act like <tt>r</tt>)

<p><tt>S</tt> 'Second' pushes the number of microseconds
elapsed since the last whole second.

<p>The timer and mark-list are considered global and static,
shared amongst all IP's, in order to retain tame behaviour.

<p>This timer is not affected by 'time travel' contrivances.

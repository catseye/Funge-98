<p>Under development.

<p>After successfully loading TOYS, the instructions
<tt>A</tt>, <tt>B</tt>, <tt>C</tt>, <tt>D</tt>,
<tt>E</tt>, <tt>F</tt>, <tt>G</tt>, 
<tt>H</tt>, <tt>I</tt>, <tt>J</tt>, <tt>K</tt>,
<tt>L</tt>, <tt>M</tt>, <tt>N</tt>, <tt>O</tt>,
<tt>P</tt>, <tt>Q</tt>, 
<tt>R</tt>, <tt>S</tt>, <tt>T</tt>, <tt>U</tt>, <tt>V</tt>, <tt>W</tt>,
<tt>X</tt>, <tt>Y</tt>, and <tt>Z</tt>
take on new semantics (and INTERCAL-esque names).

<P><tt>C</tt> ('bracelet')
pops three vectors off the stack and performs
a low-order copy of Funge-Space.

<p><tt>K</tt> ('scissors')
pops three vectors off the stack and performs
a high-order copy of Funge-Space.

<p><tt>M</tt> ('kittycat')
pops three vectors off the stack and performs
a low-order move (copy & erase original) of Funge-Space.

<p><tt>V</tt> ('dixiecup')
pops three vectors off the stack and performs
a high-order move of Funge-Space.

<p><tt>S</tt> ('chicane')
pops two vectors off the stack, then a cell,
then fills that area of Funge-Space homogenously with that cell's
value.

<p>Which order a copy or move takes is important if you copy
or move to an overlapping area.  Ensure when implementing these
that the order is preserved in all dimensions.

<p>The first two vectors are like the arguments to <tt>o</tt>.
In all except <tt>S</tt>, the third is the destination, relative
to the origin.

<p><tt>J</tt> ('fishhook')
pops a value off the stack, and causes the current
column (y coordinate) of Funge-space
to be translated north (if value is negative) or south (if positive)
that many rows.

<p><tt>O</tt> ('boulder')
pops a value off the stack, and causes the current
row (x coordinate) of Funge-space
to be translated west (if value is negative) or east (if positive)
that many columns.

<p><tt>L</tt> ('corner')
works like <tt>'</tt> except it picks up the cell
to the "left" of the IP's line and does not skip over anything.
(Historians may note that this works like "Get Left Hand" did
in Befunge-97.)  The cell to the "left" of the IP is the IP's
position, plus its delta rotated -90 degrees about the Z axis
(a la <tt>[</tt>)

<p><tt>R</tt> ('can opener')
is a corresponding instruction that mirrors <tt>L</tt>
and works to the right, rotated 90 degrees about the Z axis
("Get Right Hand" from Befunge-97)

<p><tt>I</tt> ('doric column')
pops a value off the stack, increments it,
and pushes it back onto the stack.

<p><tt>D</tt> ('toilet seat')
pops a value off the stack, decrements it,
and pushes it back onto the stack.

<p><tt>N</tt> ('lightning bolt')
pops a value off the stack, negates it,
and pushes it back onto the stack.

<p><tt>H</tt> ('pair of stilts')
pops a value <i>b</i> off the stack, then a value
<i>a</i>, then binary-shifts <i>a</i> <i>b</i> places left if <i>b</i>
is positive, or |<i>b</i>| places right if <i>b</i> is negative.

<p><tt>A</tt> ('gable')
pops a cell <i>n</i> off the stack, then another cell,
then pushes <i>n</i> copies of that cell onto the stack.

<p><tt>B</tt> ('pair of shoes')
pops two cells off the stack and pushes the result
of a "butterfly" bit operation.

<p><tt>E</tt> ('pitchfork head')
pops all values off the stack and pushes their sum
back onto it.

<p><tt>P</tt> ('mailbox')
pops all values off the stack and pushes their product
back onto it.

<p><tt>F</tt> ('calipers')
pops a vector, then a value <i>i</i>.  Treating
the rest of the
stack as <i>j</i> groups of <i>i</i> cells each, it writes this
2D matrix into Funge-space in row-major order,
with it's least point as the given vector.

<p><tt>G</tt> ('counterclockwise')
pops a vector, then a value <i>i</i>.  It then
pushes onto the stack <i>j</i> groups of <i>i</i> cells each
which it retrieves as a 2D matrix in Funge-space in row-major
order, the least point of which being the vector supplied to it.

<p><tt>Q</tt> ('necklace')
pops a value off the stack and places it into the cell
directly behind the IP (kind of like <tt>s</tt>, except behind, and
no cell is skipped over.)

<p><tt>T</tt> ('barstool')
pops a dimension number off the stack; if it's
a 0, acts like <tt>_</tt>; if it's 1, acts like <tt>|</tt>;
if it's 2, acts like <tt>m</tt>; etc. depending on
the number of available dimensions as appropriate of course.

<p><tt>U</tt> ('tumbler')
is like <tt>?</tt> but one-shot.  When executed, it
randomly transmutes into one of <tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>&gt;</tt>,
<tt>^</tt>, <tt>v</tt>, <tt>h</tt>, or <tt>l</tt>, depending on
the number of available dimensions as appropriate of course.

<p><tt>W</tt> ('television antenna')
pops a vector off the stack, then a value.
If the cell at that vector (plus the storage offset)
in Funge-Space (a la <tt>g</tt>)
is equal to that value, nothing happens.  If the cell in space
is less than the value, it pushes the value and the vector (inverted)
back onto the stack, and backs up the IP (subtracts the IP's
delta from it's position, sort of a 'wait to try again'
condition, useful mainly in Concurrent Funge.)  If
the cell in space is greater than that value, acts like <tt>r</tt>.

<p><tt>X</tt> ('buried treasure')
increments the IP's x coordinate.

<p><tt>Y</tt> ('slingshot')
increments the IP's y coordinate.

<p><tt>Z</tt> ('barn door')
increments the IP's z coordinate.

<p>These three instructions are useful at the end of a line, to
indicate "proceed to next line then wrap".  Note the IP's delta
motion is still fully in effect.

Funge-98 Specification Documents
================================

*Distribution Revision: Summer 2018*

**Funge-98** is a family of programming languages (primarily Befunge-98,
Unefunge-98, and Trefunge-98) which was designed as a successor to
[Befunge-93][].

This distribution is the canonical place to find the specs for Funge-98.

They are:

*   [Funge-98 Final Specification](doc/funge98.markdown)
*   [Funge-98 Fingerprints Library](library/)
*   [Funge-98 ERRATA](doc/ERRATA.markdown)
